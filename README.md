- Solved [ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux](https://github.com/balazik/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux) model pollution problem.
- **🆕 Commercial-friendly FaceNet implementation** - Alternative to InsightFace for commercial usage without licensing restrictions.
- Supported use with `TeaCache` (Need use with [ComfyUI_Patches_ll](https://github.com/lldacing/ComfyUI_Patches_ll)).
- Supported use with [Comfy-WaveSpeed](https://github.com/chengzeyi/Comfy-WaveSpeed), supported by `Comfy-WaveSpeed` in [commit-36ba3c8](https://github.com/chengzeyi/Comfy-WaveSpeed/commit/36ba3c8b74735d4521828507a4bf323df1a9a9d0).
- Supported simple use with `First Block Cache` (Can use with [ComfyUI_Patches_ll](https://github.com/lldacing/ComfyUI_Patches_ll)).

Must uninstall or disable `ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux` and other PuLID-Flux nodes before install this plugin. Due to certain reasons, I used the same node's name `ApplyPulidFlux`.

Need upgrade ComfyUI Version>=0.3.7

## 🏢 Commercial Usage Ready

This plugin now supports **FaceNet-based face analysis** as an alternative to InsightFace, making it suitable for commercial applications:

- **No ArcFace licensing restrictions** - FaceNet is freely available for commercial use
- **Compatible API** - Drop-in replacement for InsightFace workflows
- **Production ready** - Reliable face detection and embedding generation

Simply use `PulidFluxFaceNetLoader` instead of `PulidFluxInsightFaceLoader` in your workflows.

## Update logs
### 2025.02.19
- Fix: when selecting a face from multiple faces as a reference, embeddings and alignment features maybe not from the same face.
### 2025.02.18
- Supported selecting a face from multiple faces as a reference. [Example workflow](examples/PuLID_select_ref_face.png).
### 2025.01.27
- Changed the model path of facexlib to `ComfyUI/models/facexlib/`.
- When automatically downloading, modify the path of Antelope v2 model to `ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/`.
- Changed the model path of EVA_CLIP_L_14_336 to `ComfyUI/models/clip/`.

Tips:

- If you use `ComfyUI_windows_portable` and encounter the following error, please see https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/issues/2576
```

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

  - Traditional InsightFace-based analysis
  - See chapter [PuLID models](#pulid-models)
- PulidFluxEvaClipLoader
  - See chapter [PuLID models](#pulid-models)
- ApplyPulidFlux
  - Solved the model pollution problem of the original plugin ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux
  - **Works with both FaceNet and InsightFace** - seamless compatibility
  - `attn_mask` ~~may not work correctly (I have no idea how to apply it, I have tried multiple methods and the results have been not satisfactory)~~ works now.
  - If you want use with [TeaCache](https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache), must put it before node [`FluxForwardOverrider` and `ApplyTeaCachePatch`](https://github.com/lldacing/ComfyUI_Patches_ll).
  - If you want use with [Comfy-WaveSpeed](https://github.com/chengzeyi/Comfy-WaveSpeed), must put it before node `ApplyFBCacheOnModel`.
- FixPulidFluxPatch (Deprecated)
  - If you want use with [TeaCache](https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache), must link it after node `ApplyPulidFlux`, and link node [`FluxForwardOverrider` and `ApplyTeaCachePatch`](https://github.com/lldacing/ComfyUI_Patches_ll) after it.
- PulidFluxOptions
  - `input_faces_order` - Sorting rule for detected bboxes.
    - `left-right`: Sort the left boundary of bbox by column from left to right.
    - `right-left`: Reverse order of `left-right` (Sort the left boundary of bbox by column from right to left).
    - `top-bottom`: Sort the top boundary of bbox by row from top to bottom.
    - `bottom-top`: Reverse order of `top-bottom` (Sort the top boundary of bbox by row from bottom to top).
    - `small-large`: Sort the area of bbox from small to large.
    - `large-small`: Sort the area of bbox from large to small.
  - `input_faces_index` - The target index of the sorted bboxes.
  - `input_faces_align_mode` - Choose the detection method for aligning facial features. 
    - `0`: Old version method, When there is a face in an image, the selected facial embedding amount and alignment features maybe not consistent. 
    - `1`: Keep the selected facial embedding amount and alignment features consistent.
    - There is a slight difference between the two mode, with the `align_face` value of `1` resulting smaller area than the `embed_face` value of `0`.
- PulidFluxFaceDetector
  - Can check the facial features applied in `ApplyPulidFlux`.
  - **Works with both FaceNet and InsightFace** backends
  - When `input_faces_align_mode = 0`, the `embed_face` and `align_face` should be the same face, but they are generated by different detectors, and the number detected may be not consistent, so they may be not the same face.
  - When `input_faces_align_mode = 1`, the `embed_face` and `align_face` are always the same face, they are generated by same detectors.
  - `face_bbox_image` - Draw the detected facial bounding box (the result of the `embed_face`'s detector).

## Usage Examples

### Commercial Workflow (FaceNet)
```
PulidFluxFaceNetLoader -> ApplyPulidFlux
```

### Research Workflow (InsightFace) 
```
PulidFluxInsightFaceLoader -> ApplyPulidFlux
```

Both workflows produce compatible results and can be used interchangeably.
